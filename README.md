## Install

### NPM

This library can be installed via [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/), using the default registry:

    npm i web-midi-player

Alternatively, you can set up `npm` to use [GPR](https://github.com/features/packages) to install the library. The dependency can be then installed like this:

    npm i @yvesgurcan/web-midi-player

Whichever registry you've used, you can then use ES module syntax to load the dependency.

    import MidiPlayer from 'web-midi-player';

Or use the CommonJS module system.

    const MidiPlayer = require('web-midi-player');

### CDN

Alternatively, you can add this library to your project with a `script` tag.

    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/web-midi-player@latest/index.js"></script>

The library will be accessible under `window['web-midi-player'].default`.

    <script>
        const { 'web-midi-player': { default: MidiPlayer } } = window;
    </script>

## Getting started

**This package requires MIDI instrument patches compatible with [Timidity](https://sourceforge.net/projects/timidity/) (`.pat` files) in order to play audio.**

By default, the player loads [instrument patches via the jsDeliver CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/midi-instrument-patches).

    const midiPlayer = new MidiPlayer();
    midiPlayer.play({ url: 'song.mid' });

Alternatively, you can [download instrument patches and add them to your project](https://github.com/yvesgurcan/midi-instrument-patches/releases/latest/download/patches.zip). Make sure to provide the path to the uncompressed files when instantiating the MIDI player.

    const midiPlayer = new MidiPlayer({ patchUrl: 'public/patches/' });
    midiPlayer.play({ url: 'song.mid' });

## Browser compatibility

This library relies on the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) and more specifically the [AudioContext interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext) to control MIDI playback. This library will not function as expected with [browsers that do not fully support this API](https://caniuse.com/#search=audiocontext).

It is currently not possible to use Web Midi Player with any version of Internet Explorer.
